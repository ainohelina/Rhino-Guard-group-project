# Rhino-Guard-group-project
Group project for the course User Interface construction. All the codes and files in this project were done with Fiia-Maria (fiiamh) and the workload was divided equally. The aim of the project was to design and implement an interactive, user-oriented interface combining individual design work and collaborative development within a group. The project focused on a real-world context in which the user interface had to function in challenging conditions and support users through clear, reliable, and easy-to-learn interaction. During the project, we practiced user-centered design, justifying user interface solutions using known usability heuristics, and coordinating different perspectives into a unified user interface.
The learning objectives focused particularly on the design and prototyping of interactive user interfaces, collaboration skills in the design process, critical evaluation of design solutions, and understanding how individual components together form a coherent user interface that supports user needs.

How to set the environment:

# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
